# true_graphene

A Transparent, Reproducible, Usable by Others, Extensible (TRUE) simulation workflow of a graphene
slit pore.

## How is This Workflow TRUE?
All of the files needed to build and run this simulation are contained within this workflow.
Additionally, the Python functions and classes to initialize and parametrize the system are freely
available on GitHub, making the workflow transparent.  Because all of the files and code are freely
available, any user should be able to run this simulation and get similar results, making this
workflow reproducible.

Any user of this worklow is
also free to change any of the system or simulation parameters.  For instance, the temperature this
simulation is run at can easily be changed within the GROMACS mdp files contained in this repository.
Thus making the workflow usable by others and extensible.
