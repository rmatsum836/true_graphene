    "Graphene is a suitable material for electrodes due to their high specific surface area (SSA).  Often, the interactions between graphene pores and fluid molecules are studied with MD simulations through the use of slit pore models.  The goal of this notebook is to highlight how we can simulate a graphene slit pore system in a transparent, reproducible, extensible, and usable by others (TRUE) manner.\n",
